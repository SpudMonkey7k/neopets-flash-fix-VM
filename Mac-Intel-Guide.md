# Mac (Intel) VM Guide

### Preface:
[!NOTE]
This was tested on OSX Catalina; others have followed this guide and it had worked for them!

This guide is overly detailed to make it approachable, so  don't be put off by all the steps. It should be as easy to follow as possible. Some computer knowledge will definitely help.

***Please read this entire guide before starting.*** You don't need to memorize it, but some information later on will definitely prove useful during installation, and there is no way to order everything perfectly for all use cases.

**Initial Downloads**
1. Download [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) MacOS/Intel.
2. Download Windows 10 64-bit ISO from [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10).
> Make sure that you select proper product language that works for you; this guide used English.

6. At minimum, select 2GB (2048MB) of Base Memory and 1 Processor then click Next.
> I'd recommend 4GB memory and 2 processors, but depending on your machine's specs you may be unable to allocate that.

7. Default Drive allocation should be enough; click Next.
8. Click Finish
9. Start the VM by double clicking on it or selecting it then pressing start.

10. Follow on-screen instructions to complete Win10 install.
> [!NOTE]
> You do not need to use a Win10 Product Key as Microsoft allows you to use Windows 10 without a key.
